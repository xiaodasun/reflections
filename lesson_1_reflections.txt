What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    手动提交：
    	优点：每次提交都是按逻辑块来做的修改
    	缺点：提交的频率可能过快或过慢，或者忘记提交
    自动提交：
    	优点：每次提交都是固定的，避免忘记提交
    	缺点：提交的版本可能不是一个逻辑块

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Fill in your answer here
    在一些需要多个文件的项目中，有些文件之间相互有联系，所以一次提交报错多个文件有利于保持文件之间的一致性，同时也保持了逻辑性。
